# **FSM Generator**

Using main.py file, you can generate FSMs from XML files generated by DRAW.io.

## Instructions 

  1)Create your diagram.It is recommended to follow the examples in 'Untitled Diagram.drawio' file. Follow the rules:
    - States can be circles and rectangles.
    - States with more than one transitions must have a 'else' transition
    - Remember the Variables list and outputs list
  
  2)Copy XML from the diagram to a file.(On DRAW.io to Extras->Edit Diagram)
  
  3) Run the main.py using the terminal with **python3 main.py <XML_file_name.xml> <name_of_the_fsm> **
